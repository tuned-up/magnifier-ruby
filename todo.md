TODO
* vectorize `optimize_threshold` method. Maybe use separate class
* implement true multivarian gaussian distr(requires covariance matrix)
* ~~import/export current state(without training sets)~~ n.b.: with training sets
* add configurable option for training speed(or check for convergence of f1)
* implement other ways to check algorithm performance
* add check for training set dimensions on init (do not allow set where number of features > number of examples)
* namespace exeptions
* write more specs
* modify feature vector in case it comes as non-gaussian
